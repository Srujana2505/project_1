# Travelpostcovid
Owing to its unique culture, diversity and unparalleled hospitality our country India, attracts more
than 10 MILLION tourists every year from across the world. In fact, tourism industry contributes
about 9% of India’s GDP and the sector recorded a 3.2% growth from 2018, but this amazing
trajectory comes to a sudden halt due to the COVID19 pandemic. COVID-19 came as a major hit to
all the industries in the world but the industry which has suffered the most is the ‘Tourism Industry’.
This has not just affected our economy but it has left 12% of India’s population unemployed. But
things can’t remain at a halt for too long, as the world is adjusting to the new normal, the travel
industry too is finding new ways to do so and resume to business with all the necessary precautions.
Here is our little attempt at helping the travel industry resume to business with full power: We the
members of dev_squad have made a website, “travelpostcovid” through which people will be able
to access information about some unique and hidden spots in our beautiful motherland and will be
able to plan their perfect post lockdown trip with full precautions.
