                    There are only 20 spots in India where you will be able to find the 
                    Red Panda. One such location in India is the Namdapha National Park. 
                    Where ever Red Panda is, you will have to preserve its population as 
                    they are very rare to find. This is the third-largest park and also 
                    it is a hotspot for Biodiversity in the country. This is the park 
                    where we will be able to spot all the four big cats including the tiger, 
                    leopard, clouded leopard and snow leopard. Hire a guide from Duban to 
                    hike through the rain forests until you reach Lisu Village. You can go 
                    to both this place and Arshu to spot the Red Pandas.
