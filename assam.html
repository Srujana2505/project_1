                only is the place is full of lush green plantations but the city 
                also offers its visitors with a variety of experiences including 
                adventure activities. At the same time, the city is considered to 
                be quite developed as well. Considering how small the town is, 
                it is surprising how the place is also quite well connected with 
                the rest of India by different means of transport, visitors can
