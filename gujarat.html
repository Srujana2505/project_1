                Gopnath Beach is situated on the Gulf of Khambat. It is at an 
                approximate distance of 70 km from Bhavnagar. Away from the hustle 
                bustle of the city, this place is a must visit if you ever plan a 
                trip to Gujarat. The beach is famous for its surreal natural beauty, 
                limestone cliffs and rich biodiversity. New disinfection and cleaning 
                procedures have been adopted this year in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.
