            The eye-pleasing white waterfall of Arbi is one of
            those offbeat places in Karnataka that is surely
            deserved to be explored. The region experiences a lot
            of rainfall and the hilly terrain of the place carves out
            a gorgeous pavement for the rainwater to flow
            downhill thereby creating an amazing sight. One can
            also enjoy Hiking in this place.Also known as Bandaje
            falls, it is formed by a tributary of Netravathi river and
            is located in a remote area of western ghats, which
            can be reached through trekking with the help of
            guides.
