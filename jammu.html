            Have you ever come across snow leopards? Well, Ladakh&#39;s Hemis National Park is considered to be the
            capital of Snow Leopard of India. What makes this national park exceptional is the fact that aside from
            inhabiting the famed snow leopard, it is also the only national park in the northern regions of the
            Himalayas.
