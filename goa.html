        <h2>Harvalem Falls</h2>
        <img src = "https://cdn.kimkim.com/files/a/images/7f3d8810ea8e28a5c5b060cccf733c4f54045f28/big-e1cf55ab86430711fc59a119eb2e73d0.jpg" alt = "a picture of waterfalls"

            At a distance of 42 km from Panjim, this waterfall is hidden from the visitors. Being away from the
            beach, tourists seldom visit this translucent waterfall. Surrounded by dense forest, the Harvalem
            waterfall is a treat to the eye. There is also a Lord Shiva temple nearby and the unexplored
            Arvalem caves too. If you want complete privacy, you might consider visiting this offbeat location
            in Goa. The waterfall has enough water during November to march and so it is recommended to
            visit during these months. You can get the transport options to reach here from either Panjim or
            Mupasa. There are a lot of couple friendly hotels in Goa so plan a visit soon.

            Goa was found by the Portuguese and was home to them until the British drove them out. You can
            still see the influence of Portuguese architecture when you visit old Goa. However, if you want to
            witness the grandeur of Portuguese architecture, you might consider visiting the Sinquerim fort.
            Located beside the Sinquerim beach in Sinquerim village, the fort is a rather unexplored place in
            Goa that offers the best stunning views. If you love taking pictures, the fort would be a delight to
            you. You can also relax by the beach which is very less crowded and away from the buzz. The lace
            seems to cater to people who love a less busy place with its numerous luxury hotels and
            accommodations. You can also indulge in swimming, fishing, scuba diving and windsurfing here
            which makes the visit more worthwhile. At just an hour away from the Goa Airport, Sinquerim is a
            must-visit place.

        <h2>Rivona Caves</h2>

        <pre>
            The best way to visit these caves is on a bike. Take the state highway 7 and continue straight on it
            for around an hour until you hit the Tilamol-Curdi area. Just after 10 minutes, you will find the
            Rivona caves. The cave is believed to be a place of meditation of a Buddhist monk and the laterite
            rock inside is sid to be his meditation seat. Not just that, the insides of the cave have been carved
            with numerous Buddhist sculptures, paintings which make the caves a treat to the eyes. The caves
            are located in Rivona Village in South Goa and the view of the sea from there is just a cherry on
            top. The unique style of these caves surely makes it a must-visit.
