                No better place to learn about Tripura than an archaeological site 
                where many statues, structures, and antiquities dating back 1200 years 
                were found. The symbols on the sandstone sculptures discovered in Pilak 
                suggest a heterodox culture fused with both Hinduism and Buddhism was 
                present during 9-13 centuries. If you’re interested in learning about the 
                medieval history of India, you can’t miss the historic ruins at Pilak, Tripura.

                Neermahal, which translates to the Water Palace, is the larger of the two 
                water palaces in India. The palace was built in 1930 by a British company 
                as a summer residence for Maharaja of Tripura who envisioned a majestic 
                water palace floating in the middle of gorgeous Rudrasagar Lake. Located 
                in Melaghar, 53 km away from Agartala, the lake palace exemplifies His 
                Majesty’s fascinating taste in its architecture blending Medieval Hindu 
                and Rajput styles.
