                The Chandipur coast has attained global popularity for its ‘Vanishing Sea’ 
                phenomenon. Here one can literally see the sea disappear (read recede) by 
                almost 5 to 6 kilometres everyday during low tide and then comes back at high 
                tide. This rare event occurs twice a day. 
                The receding waters at low tide offer an excellent opportunity to walk into 
                the sea, ride a bike or even drive a car! The exciting prospect of venturing 
                fearlessly into the seabed attracts a lot of curious visitors to this beach.
