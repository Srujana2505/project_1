                Mamit, situated in the western part of Mizoram, is the fourth largest district 
                that you cannot afford to miss during a visit to Mizoram, not just because it is 
                one of the most beautiful places in Mizoram with its gorgeous sunsets and 
                spellbinding vistas, but also because you can take exciting rides, go caving and 
                even observe the wildlife. One of the main tourist attractions in Mamit is Dampa 
                Tiger Reserve, the largest wildlife sanctuary of Mizoram where some of the animals 
                that you can expect to see are leopard, swamp deer, tiger, and hoolock gibbon.

                Lawngtlai, located in the southern part of Mizoram, has exciting opportunities 
                for sightseeing and exploration as a travel destination. The tourist attractions 
                which are popular among tourists, and which find a mention in every Lawngtlai 
                travel guide, are its wildlife sanctuaries and the colossal Blue Mountain. The 
                entire district is overlooked by the enormous Phwangpui, also known as the Blue 
                Mountain, because of a thin stretch of clouds which lend it a bluish appearance 
                from a distance. At an impressive height of almost 2,157 meters, it looks like a 
                colossal fort built by nature.
