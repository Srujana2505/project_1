                If trekking is what you have on your mind, then Sandhan Valley is a must go 
                offbeat destination in Maharashtra for you. The travelers here are greeted by 
                the sight of a canyon set in the midst of the beautiful Western Ghats. Also 
                known as the Valley of Shadow, the descent of the canyon is 1500 meters. One 
                of the best things to do here is to go for a morning trek or try rappelling 
                here to see the spots where the narrow ravine harnesses spots where the sunrays 
                can’t touch the ground and justifies the name Valley of Shadows.
