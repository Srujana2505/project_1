        <h2>Key Monastery, Spiti Valley:</h2>
        <img src = "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xFIpwO5pzi8/Wd8XJzenigI/AAAAAAAACEk/qf1NqinM2nMM3wTBeT_1494ZCyGQWMGfACLcBGAs/s1600/Key-Monastery-Spiti-Valley.jpg"/>

            Situated at 4100m above sea level, Key Monastery or Kye Gompa is on the edge of a hill, overlooking
            the Spiti River. It looks even more beautiful from a distance as if it is hanging from an almost cliff-like
            hill. One can witness the morning chanting and prayer session of monks in their trademark red
            garments, creating a beautiful ambience. Tourists can go there via train from Shimla or on car or public transport

        <h2>Churdhar Peak, Sirmaur:</h2>

            One of the best places for trekking, the Churdhar Peak rises to an elevation of 12000ft from sea level
            and is the highest in the outer Himalayas. It is also known as Churchandni (Bangle of Snow) and has
            spectacular landscapes. Trekkers tread over small glaciers on their way to the Churdhar summit,
            which has moderate to heavy snowfall (average of 33 feet snow). Often, the Shirgul Temple gets
            buried under it. On clear sunny days, the Badrinath and Kedarnath shrines, Gangetic plains, the Sutlej
            river, Kailash peak, and hills of Shimla and Chakrata can be seen.

        <h2>Kaza, Lahaul, and Spiti:</h2>

            The beautiful Kaza is located at an altitude of about 12,500 ft from sea level and is one of the coldest
            and most beautiful places of Himachal Pradesh. Kaza is surrounded by high mountains, crystal clear
            rivers, streams, and barren landscapes interspersed with green landscapes and meadows. It is a
            marvellous destination with several beautiful palaces, monasteries, gompas, historical buildings,
            mountain terrains, and trekking tracks, etc. One can easily reach this amazing spot from Kinnaur
            Valley and Lahaul Valley via cab or bus.
