                Amongst the most famous places in Bihar is Gaya, which is a Hindu 
                pilgrimage hub and a transit point for Buddhist pilgrimage centre of 
                Bodhgaya. It is believed that it was here under the tree that Buddha 
                attained enlightenment. Gaya is a busy city situated on the bank of 
                River Phalgu and it is replete with many temples and historic sites 
                dating back to different eras that stand as the evidence to the successful 
                rule of Maurya and Gupta dynasty here. The glory of Gaya was extended so much 
                so that even Hiuen Tsang could not resist mentioning it in his travelogues.

                Dubbed as the seat of Bihar School of Yoga, Munger is yet another place that 
                is popular amongst the tourists in Bihar. The history of Munger dates back to 
                Aryans, who called Munger the ‘Midland’ for their settlement. For yoga buffs, 
                Munger is not an unknown name, thus we can expect a large foreign crowd thronging 
                this place. The present day Munger is a twin city, which comprises of Munger and 
                Jamalpur. Reckoned to be one of the oldest cities of Bihar, Munger was once the 
                capital of Mir Kasim before it fell into the hands of British. The place has 
                several historic relics that further add to the charm here.

            <pre>
                Vaishali is an important archaeological site that was once the capital city of 
                Licchavi rulers. Vaishali earned fame as a birthplace of last Jain Tirthankar 
                Lord Mahavira. It is believed that Mahavira was born and brought up in 6th century 
                BCE in Kundalagram of Republic of Vaishali. Another major event this place was a 
                witness to was the last sermon of Buddha in 483 BCE. Vaishali was a prosperous 
                kingdom during the time of Buddha, it is also known for its beautiful courtesan 
                Amrapali. So, you see, one has enough to recall in Vaishali and adding to its 
                historic charm is the well-preserved Ashokan Pillar. This ancient city finds 
                mention in the travel accounts of eminent Chinese travellers like Fa-hien.
