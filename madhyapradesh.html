                Patalpani waterfall is a picturesque 300 feet high waterfall surrounded 
                by thriving forest, imposing hills and pleasing landscape. The water plunges 
                on to the rocks and comes tumbling down from the heightened cliff.
                The soothing sound of the gushing water will help you relax. The pit at 
                the bottom of the waterfall is varnish clear. The legend has it that the 
                pit goes as deep as the underworld (Patal) and that is why the name, Patalpani.
