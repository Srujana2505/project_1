                These are the Living Root Bridges in Meghalaya that are spread across the 
                dense valleys of Khasi Hills region in the state of Meghalaya. The people 
                of Khasi tribe are proud inventors of this masterpiece. They trained these 
                bridges to grow from the roots of rubber trees. Amongst all the bridges, the 
                most stunning one is Umshiang Double-Decker Bridge which is more the 180-year 
                old. This is the only one in the region that has two levels, as most of the 
                bridges are single root. The second level was built by the locals of Khasi 
                tribe when once the water in the monsoon season reached the first level.
