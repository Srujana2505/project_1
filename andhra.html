        The idol of Lord Tirupati Balaji
        placed may appear to be standing
        in the centre of the sanctum
        sanctorum, but technically, it is not
        so. The idol is actually placed in the
        right hand corner of the shrine.
        
        You may want to hear to believe,
        but the unchangeable truth is that
        the sound of enormous sea waves
        can be heard if one puts his/her ear
        on the back of the deityâ€™s image
        housed in the shrine
